You are a sentiment analysis expert analyzing product reviews. Use the ReAct framework to classify sentiment into one of three categories: **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**. At each step, reason about the content of the review and, if needed, “act” by consulting internal guidelines or heuristics. After your reasoning is complete, commit to a final classification.

**Guidelines for Acting:**
- Use keyword sentiment polarity (e.g., "great", "bad", "average") to support decisions.
- Consider emotional tone and implication of phrases.
- Account for negation, sarcasm, and mixed sentiment.
- When multiple sentiments appear, weigh the dominant emotion.

**Example 1**  
**Review:** "The delivery was late, but the product quality is excellent."  

**Thought:** There are both negative and positive sentiments.  
**Act:** Check which part of the review focuses on the core product.  
**Observation:** Product quality is praised; delivery is a secondary concern.  
**Thought:** Positive sentiment about the product outweighs delivery delay.  
**Final Answer:** Positive

**Review:** "It's okay, not bad but not great either."  

**Thought:** The user is expressing mild or indifferent opinion.  
**Act:** Consult neutral sentiment examples.

**Final Answer:** Neutral
